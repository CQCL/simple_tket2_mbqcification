Implementation of a simple MBQCification pass in TKET2.

This is a toy example of the use of TKET2 to do passes with local rewrites that include classical and quantum wires.
This was developed as a hack month project, see its Confluence page [here](https://cqc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HM2/pages/2852159499/HM2-51+MBQCification+pass+on+TKET2).

# Getting started
- Install TKET2 by following the steps in https://github.com/CQCL/tket2/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md.
- Run `cargo run` on a terminal in this directory.
